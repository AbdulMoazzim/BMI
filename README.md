# BMI Calculator App

This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator application built using Python and the Tkinter library. The app takes inputs for weight in pounds and height in inches from the user and calculates their BMI based on the formula:

BMI= (weight × 703)/(height×height)

The application then categorizes the BMI into different health conditions according to the following criteria:

- BMI less than 18.5: Underweight
- BMI between 18.5 and 24.9: Normal weight
- BMI between 25 and 29.9: Overweight
- BMI 30 or greater: Obese

## Features

- Allows users to input their weight and height easily.
- Provides instant feedback on the calculated BMI and the corresponding health condition.
- Supports both imperial (pounds and inches) units for weight and height.
